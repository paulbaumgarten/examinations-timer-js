# Examinations timer

A simple HTML+Javascript+CSS tool that can be used to display exam timing information to invigilators and candidates. I wrote this to replace the "impossible to read whiteboard at the front of a hall" that schools seem to continue to use.

Time remaining will be highlighted in orange at less than 30 minutes, and in red at less than 5 minutes remaining.
